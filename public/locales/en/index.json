If you forget the password, the only solution may be to delete the information associated with that email and then re-enter it with a new password.\nI would like to draw your attention to an important matter. After you choose the name, email, and password, and then click on the \"Add\" button, you will notice a true or a false. If there is a true , it means that the email already exists, and the person you want to choose may have already logged in with that email or maybe not.
